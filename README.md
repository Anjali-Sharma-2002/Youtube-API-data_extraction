# Youtube-API-data_extraction


In this project, I utilized the YouTube Data API to gather comprehensive details on prominent data science channels. By leveraging the API, I retrieved essential information about these channels, such as their titles, descriptions, and subscriber counts. Additionally, I extended the analysis to include video-specific details, exploring key metrics like view counts, likes, and comments.

To present the findings in a visually compelling manner, I employed the Seaborn library for data visualization. Through simple and effective visualizations, I aimed to distill insights from the gathered data, offering a clear snapshot of the performance and engagement levels of these data science channels. This comprehensive approach enables a nuanced understanding of the data science landscape on YouTube, providing valuable insights for both enthusiasts and practitioners in the field.
